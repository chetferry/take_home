shred program:

cd shred

./shred testfile1.txt
./shred testfile2.bin


bootable linux image via QEMU:

cd qemu 

bash script.sh

the script will install any missing gcc and qemu requirements so it will ask for your sudo password

run the script and it prints out Hello World every 2 seconds.

I ran out of time to do more than what is included.  I hope you like it.  Thanks.
